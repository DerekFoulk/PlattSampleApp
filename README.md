# Platt Code Sample

Thank you for taking the time to review my project! In this sample, you will find a .NET Core 2.0 project wired up as requested. I also included a view that leverages React.js.

## Getting Started

This application can be ran like any .NET Core application. Before attempting to run the application, please ensure that you have the .NET Core 2.0 SDK installed.

## Thank You

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this code challenge. I had a lot of fun putting this together, thank you for your time!
